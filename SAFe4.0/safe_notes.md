PI Planing
======================================================================================================================================
PI4 -> (Huawei contract signed)
    -> Other vendors are still working for PI4

```Input     
{
	Milestone: EL2
	Scope (sub-system): [
	WebPortal, VR, Clean Cabin, Cyber Security, CEA, RC, PSA IT] 
	=> Enabler 
	=> (Difficulties, Priorities)
	=> User stories: As ... I can ... in condition
}
```

```Audit_User_Stories
According to PSA reference
{
	AC1: {
		key:PSA strategy and policy, 
		status: OK},
	AC2: ...                     
	AC3: ...
}
```


###### Before PI5 3 weeks
```Split_use_stories
{
	Counts: 150 - 180,
	Priorites: {
		Optional: >= 20%,
	}
}
```

###### Before PI5 1.5 weeks
```Acceptance_and_Review
By sub-system/feature within 2 days
{
	Best: ...
	Improvable: ...
	Enterprise value: ... (Expect vs Actual)
	Personal value: ... (Expect vs Actual)
}
```

PI5 
======================================================================================================================================

###### PI Planning - the 1st week

```Kick_off
Road map (for this particular PI) - 2 hours
Global architecture Q&A - 2 hours
```

```Release_next_user_stories
{
	Feature 1: ..., 
	Feature 2: ...,
	...,
	Enabler 1: ...,
	Eanbler 2: ...
}
```

```5 enginers * 5 days * 16 weeks = 400 days => - (2 + 3) days = 375 days => Working days during one PI```
```PI_planning_setting the 3rd day
User stories wall
```

```demo the 4th week <- started the 1st Sprint since the 2nd week 
User story acceptance 
Collabration for demo acceptance readiness
```

...... demo for each Sprint

```Preparation_for_next_PI
2 months before next PI -> Features and architecture preparation
                        -> Last call (at least one month for user stories priority alignment)
1 months before next PI -> Requirements confirmation and entering PI preparation
                        -> Full (E2Â£) function test/validation for current PI
                        -> One A&R before production depolyment
